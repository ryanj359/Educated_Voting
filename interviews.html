        Unfortunately due to time contraints I was not able to interview anyone 
        for this project, but if I was able to, I would have liked to interview 
        Jocelyn Kiley and Courtney Brown.

        <br>
        <br>

        Jocelyn Kiley, a senior associate director of research at Pew Research Center 
        mainly works on U.S. public opinion about politics and I think could have had 
        really interesting thoughts on this project.

        <br>
        <br>

        Courtney Brown, the Vice President of Impact and Planning at Lumina Foundation, 
        would have also been a great person to talk to as this foundation works to make 
        higher education more attainable and I think Courtney would have had some really 
        valuable insights to this project.
