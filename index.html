        The Democratic party was founded in 1828 and a few years down the 
        line in 1854 the Republican Party was founded. Initially, the 
        Democratic Party was the more conservative Party, supporting slavery 
        and against federal government, while the Republican party had more 
        progressive views and supported things like the 15th Amendment. 
        An ideological shift happened in the 1930s with the New Deal and by 
        the 1980s, the views of the parties became similar to how they are today.

        Education has not always been a priority in the United States as it so 
        largely is today. Dating back to Colonial America, education was extremely 
        limited and very few children attended school. The rates began to rise in 
        the late 19th century when laws were enforced where children had to attend 
        school, and these rates rose even further in the late 20th century when more 
        funding options became available for higher education.

        <br>
        <br>

        It has been said that education rates have become a very helpful predictor 
        for voter parties. According an article published by the Nisakanen Center, 
        “voters with college degrees are increasingly supporting Democrats, with 
        Republicans now doing better among those without college—a big reversal in 
        recent decades.” This website is not here to prove nor disprove this theory, 
        but to simply show the data.

        There are two sets of maps on this website. One that shows the highest voter 
        party per each county in the United States from the 1972 election to the 2020 
        election. The colors range from dark red to dark blue depending on the percent 
        of the votes in that county. The second map shows the percent of adults who have
        obtained a college degree or higher per each county in the United States from 1970 
        to 2022.

        <b>Disclaimer:</b> Some of the data presented on the maps is inaccurate. For example, 
        the voter data for the state of Louisiana is incorrect. There are certain counties 
        on both maps that are presenting as 0 (dark red) which is inaccurate and is most 
        likely an issue with the dataset.
